# CSS-Design-System-React-TS-NASA-Space-Site
A CSS design system paired with a fully functional React-TS website

This is stemmed from Kevin Powell's "Create A CSS Design System" tutorial. I have taken the design system and turned it into a React/Typescript application.
This project has been created with Vite.

This project also includes a custom hook: "useMediaQuery.tsx" which I had created to allow React to trigger a render when css media query changes were triggered.

The intention of this project is to be used as a "what to expect upon delivery" demonstration for custom dynamic website design templating.
